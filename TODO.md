Go south along the long road and come to the N. gate where the townspeople are waiting. End game text describes different outcomes based on how you played. In the best scenario, it describes you marching clean, on horseback, holding a scepter, without too much time passing. If you killed the dragon, you can stay in the village (optionally pair with smith or young woman). You even become mayor if your reputation is high enough! If you didnâ€™t kill the dragon, you make it out of the village before the angry dragon burns it down.
