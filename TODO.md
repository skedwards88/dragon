make apples be a barrel, always have apple at inn but can also put in inventory
if take apple when have apple, lose reputation. could allow take (and have x apples) or prevent take
maybe add count to apples so can have more than one

if naked, lose reputation at manor, 

instead of wizard offering to hold horse -- make the default give be "x doesn't want this item, but agrees to hold this item for you"--need to exempt squirrel

if you return the score to the wizard and have the treasure, wizard shouldn't offer the score again

when pay wizard -- make sure decrements gold
